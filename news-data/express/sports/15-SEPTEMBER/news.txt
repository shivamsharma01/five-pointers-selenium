Defending champion Ding Liren has tipped his teenage challenger D Gukesh “favourite” to win the FIDE World Chess Championship final, which will be held in Singapore later this year
The duo are currently competing in the 45th Chess Olympiad in Budapest.
“I can see my opponent (Gukesh) playing extremely well in this tournament. Maybe he is a favourite in the World Championship Match. He also has a higher rating than me,” Liren said in an interaction with the International Chess Federation (FIDE) in the mixed zone.

“I have dropped a lot since last year, but I will fight my best to try to overcome the rating difference,” he added in a rather candid admission.
Liren, 31 is the highest rated chess player of all time and won the world crown in May last year after defeating Russian GM Ian Nepomniachtchi.

Liren took a break from the game after that, owing to his battle with depression. Liren returned to action earlier this year at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament, finishing ninth in the event.
Meanwhile, on the other hand, two years after heartbreak at his home in Chennai, Gukesh has arrived at the Olympiad in Hungary’s capital like a man who has unfinished business. In the four games he has played so far at the Olympiad in Budapest after sitting out the first round, he’s accounted for four strong grandmasters — Vignir Vatnar Stefansson (Iceland), Adam Kozak (Hungary), Alexandr Predke (Serbia) and finally Aydin Suleymanli (Azerbaijan) — with an average rating of over 2600.

On Sunday, he claimed his fastest win at the 2024 Olympiad rather than the slow death that he has delivered to other opponents.
Gukesh won the Candidates tournament in April to become the youngest challenger to the world title at the age of 17. He turned 18 in May.
Liren and Gukesh will clash in Singapore from November 20 to December 15 for the coveted title and a prize fund of USD 2.50 million.

Rohit Sharma-led India are favourites to make it into the final of the World Test Championship again, which is scheduled to be played at Lord’s from June 11, 2025.
India, who have lost the previous two WTC finals are currently sitting on top of the points table with home matches to play against Bangladesh and New Zealand, starting from September 19.
Indian will then travel to Australia, who are currently placed in second position, and will play a five-match Border Gavaskar Test series, which most likely will give us the finalists for the third final.

The defending champions Australia also have an away series of two Tests in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka can be the dark horse in the WTC final race. Sri Lanka after defeating England in the third Test will have a big chance to give it a shot. Sri Lanka can finish in the top if they manage to win their two home series against New Zealand and Australia. The Dhananjaya de Silva-led team have an away series against South Africa as well.
New Zealand the inaugural WTC champions are currently placed at third place. They will be playing eight WTC matches in the span of the next two-and-half months. Out of those eight, five will be played in the sub-continent against Sri Lanka and India, respectively.
Interestingly, England’s chances to make it to the final has taken a hit after their unexpected defeat at The Oval against Sri Lanka.

Title:Aakash Chopra recalls when current Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir fought with a truck driver
Date: 2024-09-16T09:49
Synopsys: Aakash Chopra says Gautam Gambhir always wore his heart on the sleeve but also calls him a 'short-fused.'

Former and Delhi opener Aakash Chopra recollected an incident when his former teammate and current Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir fought with a truck driver.
“Gautam is someone who once fought with a truck driver in Delhi,” Chopra said in a podcast with Raj Shamani.
“He got out of his car and climb the truck to grab the collar of the driver because he made a wrong turn and was abusing. I was like, ‘Gauti, what are you doing?’ So that’s made him Gautam.”

Chopra said although Gambhir was a very hardworking cricketer but also called him “short-fused” when it comes to the temperament.
“Passionate guy. Very hardworking when it comes to his craft,” said Chopra.
“A bit serious but scored a lot of runs. He always wore his heart on the sleeve.
“Temperament wise he can be very short-fused. But everyone has a different character.”

A gritty left-handed opener, who was once ranked the best Test batsman, Gambhir has tasted success both as a captain and mentor in IPL.
Gautam Gambhir has had a history of confrontation and conflict with some of the cricketers – the name of Virat Kohli comes to mind – and Gambhir would do well to keep his personal likes and dislikes aside while guiding the Indian team.
Gautam Gambhir is taking up the job when Indian cricket is in a bullish mood, having just won the T20 World Cup. But the atmosphere will not take much time to take a turn if initial results in his tenure don’t go as desired. This is where the head coach needs to keep calm and keep the team in a good headspace.

Title:Staring at the unthinkable: Brazil’s plight in World Cup qualification points to the rot that entered its footballing soul long ago
Date: 2024-09-16T13:00
Synopsys: Losing four of its last five qualifiers, has put head coach Dorival Junior under immense pressure as superstar players fail to operate as a cohesive unit
Url: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/brazils-plight-in-world-cup-qualification-points-to-the-rot-that-entered-its-footballing-soul-long-ago-9570039/
Content: 
Brazil’s latest coach Dorival Junior has waged several battles for survival. As a journeyman defensive midfielder, he turned up for 13 different clubs in 16 years; his 25 years as manager has been scattered across 23 clubs. In between, he outlasted cancer. Yet, his biggest fight for survival could yet to be, as the coach of the most successful football country in the world, a journey intertwined with Brazil’s fate in qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.
The burden on his broad shoulders is inhuman, a crushing weight no other coach in his country has shouldered. It is not to lift the World Cup, a load most coaches in Brazil’s history had to drag, but to qualify for the World Cup. A bloated tournament — a leap from 32 to 48 — could allay some anxiety. Brazil can’t be that bad. ain’t they?
But the eventuality of the world’s most decorated football country, the breathing soul of the game for the romantics, missing out on the tournament is not just a lurid fever dream, but a distinct possibility.

The Selecao have won a lone game in the last five World Cup qualifying matches, losing not only to established rivals Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia, but even to Paraguay. At the COPA America, they crashed out before the last-four for the ninth time in major tournaments outside Brazil since 2009. But the shocking bit was not that they lost in the quarterfinals, but that they reached that stage, brandishing the sort of insipid football that would make the 1994 pragmatists red with rage.

The plain reality, cleansed of romance and nostalgia, is that they are no longer the most superior team in the Americas, rather they are the fourth or fifth best team in the continent, an imitation of an imitation.
Style had long departed Brazilian football, in the last few years it has lost its soul too. Since the 2014 World Cup, the stasis has only been disguised by its imposing history. It is a malaise classical of the fall of the world’s great empires. The decay might have set in long ago, but the brutal reality would hit only when an epochal defeat arrives. Like Brazil failing to qualify. Like how Italy felt eight years ago —now it has become normal and accepted, after they missed out on the subsequent edition too.
The difference was that Italy’s rot was bleedingly obvious. The Serie A’s drop in standards was dramatic. The great talent factory that was AC Milan disintegrated. They stopped producing impenetrable defenders and insouciant forwards, even those staple number nines.

Brazil’s dysfunction is less conspicuous. Personnel-wise, they still boast an army of highly-skilled players. The Real Madrid trident of Vinicius Junior, Endrick and Rodrygo are nightmares for most defenders in La Liga. When Neymar heals his injury, he too would be in the mix. There is no shortage of firepower and sturdiness in midfield. The defence is not slack either; they possess two of the most progressive goalkeepers in the world.
The fall guys
In such a backdrop, the knives are instantly sharpened at the coaches. To an extent, it is reasonable. The coaching standards in Europe have leapt enormously — for all the riches, Brazil has never been a coaching country.
So Brazil identified Carlo Ancelotti as Tite’s successor. But the dream never materialised, and dejected, they sought the exact opposite path and embraced the left-field option of Junior, their third manager in the last two years. Now that they have picked, it’s better that they persist with him, and give him time to build a team, to find the formula that could make them tick.
It’s a strange yet typical modern-day predicament. The coach has those that shimmer in club jerseys, but turn off their light in the famous canary yellow shirts. Maybe, it could be that they could only function in the regimented shapes and systems of the club, their imagination stifled when out of their comfort zone. Not just Brazil, a host of other teams too face this. For instance, the paradox that was Phil Foden for Manchester City and England.

The chemistry among Brazilian players in the recent outings has been non-existent, each player unto a planet, or a bunch of strangers stitched into a team. In the Paraguay game, the forward-line was toothless, neither creative nor energetic. Midfielders were ponderous – consuming too much time on the ball – functioned without coherence and were frequently outmuscled by the Paraguayans.
But Junior insists the team has improved from when he had taken over. Perhaps, he has a point. He has a clear vision — he has stepped away from the usual 4-2-2-2 to a more modern, possession-based 4-2-3-1. But his teams lack the dynamism to harness the best from the system.
The 62-year-old is popular among the public and media, and has pleaded for patience after every defeat. “We’re working with love and patience. We all want this team to get back to where it once was. The results weren’t what we wanted — I accept that and take responsibility — but I have no doubt that this team will grow from here,” he said after the COPA exit.
He offered another reality check too. “The world has grown and understands football more and more. We face difficult opponents. All the big teams in the world are going through the same thing. It’s harder to get results than it once was,” he had said. It is true, but none of the harsh realities would win him sympathy in his latest fight for survival.

Title:Chess Olympiad: Two years after Chennai heartbreak, Gukesh on another winning spree
Date: 2024-09-16T08:13
Synopsys: Gukesh has arrived at the Olympiad in Hungary’s capital like a man who has unfinished business. In the four games he has played so far at the Olympiad in Budapest after sitting out the first round, he’s accounted for four strong grandmasters.

Eyebrows shot up, heads were cocked and frowns made appearances as some of the world’s top players, including former and current world champions like Magnus Carlsen, Vladimir Kramnik and Ding Liren caught a glimpse of Gukesh’s battle against Azerbaijan’s Aydin Suleymanli, which the teenager from India ended up winning in 38 moves.
There’s something about Gukesh and Olympiads. Two years back, at the Chess Olympiad hosted in his hometown of Chennai, a 16-year-old Gukesh had given one of the first indicators that he was going to be a problem for the rest of the world.
Playing on the top board of the India B team at the Chess Olympiad in 2022, Gukesh (back then ranked World No 20) had gone on a rampage, smiting away at anyone who sat in front of him, even the world’s best players like Fabiano Caruana. But all of his work had been undone in a sense as he had lost against Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Abdusattorov in the 10th round, which meant that the team lost the tie. What had stung in that game more than the defeat itself was the realisation that even if he had taken a draw in that game, India would have more or less been assured gold as Praggnanandhaa had put India ahead. Eventually, the Indian team had claimed bronze while Uzbekistan took gold.

Two years after that heartbreak, Gukesh has arrived at the Olympiad in Hungary’s capital like a man who has unfinished business. In the four games he has played so far at the Olympiad in Budapest after sitting out the first round, he’s accounted for four strong grandmasters — Vignir Vatnar Stefansson (Iceland), Adam Kozak (Hungary), Alexandr Predke (Serbia) and finally Aydin Suleymanli (Azerbaijan) — with an average rating of over 2600.
On Sunday, he claimed his fastest win at the 2024 Olympiad rather than the slow death that he has delivered to other opponents.
Playing with white pieces in a game that saw the Giuoco Pianissimo Variation of the Italian game being used, Gukesh had engine-like accuracy. By the 10th move, he held a 30-minute advantage on the clock. By the 13th move, he was the evaluation bar’s preferred pick to win the contest. By the 15th move, he had a material advantage on the board, with Suleymanli being a rook, and two pawns down.

  A post shared by FIDE (@fide_chess)
It was really a matter of playing the perfect moves and letting the opponent make mistakes. And Gukesh, who is one of the best calculating players in the sport, did just that, squeezing the life blood out of his opponent’s pieces on the board slowly one move at a time until he was ready to throw in the towel.
By the time both queens were beheaded in the 38th move, Gukesh was one move away from reincarnating a pawn into a queen. It was a completely lost position, and his opponent resigned.

Thanks to the win, Gukesh now has 2775.9 points in the live ratings and is ranked No 5 in the world, just behind compatriot Arjun Erigaisi in the live rankings (which are updated real time as opposed to the FIDE published rankings, which are announced at the end of each month).
Gukesh had, in fact, moved to fifth spot on Saturday itself after winning his almost six-hour battle against Alexandr Predke of Serbia.

India thus have three players in the live rankings, with Arjun fourth, Gukesh fifth and Praggnanandhaa in 10th spot.
Spurred by Gukesh, the Indian team defeated the strong Azerbaijan team in the fifth round with a 3-1 scoreline to take two more game points. While Arjun also defeated Rauf Mamedov to claim one full point for India, Praggnanandhaa (facing Nijat Abasov) and Vidit Santosh Gujrathi (taking on Shakhriyar Mamedyarov) settled for draws.

Title:Sunil Gavaskar cautions India ahead of Bangladesh series: ‘They are a force to reckon with…’
Date: 2024-09-16T14:07
Synopsys: Gavaskar opined that it would have been better for star players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to have participated in the Duleep Trophy

Content: 
India will play home Test series against Bangladesh starting on Thursday in Chennai. Despite India’s formidable home record former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar cautioned the Indian team about the visitors and gave the example of their recent historic series whitewash against Pakistan.
“By beating Pakistan in both the Test matches played in Pakistan, the Bangladesh team have shown that they are a force to reckon with. Even a couple of years back, when India toured Bangladesh, they were given a good fight by the Bangladeshis. Now with the series win against Pakistan under their belt, they are primed to take on India too,” wrote Sunil Gavaskar in his Mid-Day Column.
“They have some fine players in their ranks and some new promising players who no longer have the awe of the opposition that seemed to characterise their early forays into the international game. Now, every team that play them know they can’t put their guard down as they could be knocked down as the Pakistanis found out. It will certainly be a series to look forward to,” he added.

Gavaskar opined that it would have been better for star players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to have participated in the Duleep Trophy. He would reason that lack of game time in the mid-thirties might weaken the “muscle memory” of players if they don’t play high standards for prolonged periods.
“The selectors have not picked the skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for the Duleep Trophy so they will most likely go into the Bangladesh Test series without much match practice. Once a player hits the mid-thirties in any sport, then regular competition will help him maintain the high standards he has set,” Gavaskar said.
Rohit last played a red-ball game in the final Test against England in Dharmshala earlier this year whereas Kohli last appeared in the format for India in the New Year Test at Cape Town in South Africa. “When there’s a longish gap then the muscle memory weakens somewhat and to get back to the high standards from earlier is not easy,” Gavaskar added.
